Developing and Evaluating Intraday Trading Strategies Using Market Data

In this project, you will develop and evaluate intraday trading strategies using market data from a simulated intraday market data. 
You will have the flexibility to choose your own data source, such as stock prices, currency exchange rates, or commodity prices, 
and develop their own trading strategy based on technical analysis or machine learning techniques.

The project will consist of three main stages:

## Stage 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
You will collect and preprocess intraday market data from a random generator or from a selected financial instrument or market using  Python. 
The data should include time series of price, volume, and other relevant market variables.  
Two market generators are provided (mkdata.py and mkdata2.py) and both generate microsecond data with the following columns:
```
'Timestamp': timestamps,
'Bid Price': bid_prices,
'Bid Quantity': bid_quantities,
'Offer Price': offer_prices,
'Offer Quantity': offer_quantities
```
## Data Sources:
[TrueFX](https://www.truefx.com/): tick data of currency pairs. 
- Note that for currency pairs, there are no volume data available due to the scale of the market. You can only
obtain timestamp, bid price and ask price. 

[Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/):
- Tick data for almost everything (daily download only)
- 3 methods to download data from Dukascopy:
  1. From their website. 
     - pros: can download tick data of any listed assets
     - cons: can only download one day of tick data
  2. Using the function download_fx_data from DataDownloadFunctions.py
     - pros: can specify date range
     - cons: can only download FX pairs
  3. Using [dukascopy-node](https://www.dukascopy-node.app/):
     - pros: can download pretty much anny assets, can also specify date range
     - cons: a bit tricky to set up
     - Set-up:
       1. install node.js via https://nodejs.dev/en/download/
       2. go to terminal and install the library using: ```npm install dukascopy-node --save```
       3. go to [this awesome website](https://www.dukascopy-node.app/instruments) to get instructions on
       downloading different asset's tick data. An example for AAPL tick data is:
       ```npx dukascopy-node -i aaplususd -from 2023-01-01 -to 2023-01-12 -t m1 -f csv``` A csv file will be saved
       at your download folder (on MacOS it is saved under user/download rather than your usual Download)

## Stage 2: Create Bar Data
You will create bar data and explain the different kind of bar data you managed to create.  
### Motivation:
- How to deal with the irregularities of the arrival of bars is the focus of this stage.
- This stage follows Chapter 2 from Marcos de Lopez's *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*.

### Types of bar data:
#### Standard Bars:
Given that these bars arrive at irregular frequencies, we call this series of bars inhomogeneous series. 
Standard bars transform them from inhomogeneous series to homogeneous series derived from regular sampling.  

Includes: ```['timestamp', 'vwap', 'open', 'close', 'high', 'low', 'volume']```
- **Time Bars (avoid)**:
  - Obtained by sampling information at fixed time intervals (e.g. minute):
  - Should be avoided for two reasons:
    1. markets do not process information at constant time interval. Time bars can easily 
    oversample information during low-activity periods and undersample information during high-activity periods 
    (think Black Monday).
    2. Time-sampled series often exhibit poor statistical properties (serial correlation, heteroscedasticity and 
    non-normality of returns).
- **Tick Bars**:
  - Instead of sampling at constant time interval, sample at constant number of transactions (e.g. 1,000 ticks).
  - Pros: 
    - Sampling as a function of number of transactions exhibited desirable statistical properties (Gaussian).
  - Cons: 
    - Subject to outliers due to certain behaviors from exchanges during conclusion of auctions. 
    - Each transaction could differ in volume (e.g. 10 transactions each of size 1 vs. 10 transactions each of size
    1,000).
- **Volume Bars**:
  - Sampling every time a pre-defined amount of the security's unites (shares, futures contracts, etc.) have been 
  exchanged.
  - Mitigates the size of transaction issue presented in tick bars. Therefore, should be preferred over tick bar.
- **Dollar Bars**:
  - Sample an observation every time a pre-defined market value is exchanged (generally in terms of USD for currency
  pairs). Alternative, could also sample as a function of free-floating market capitalization of a company (stocks) or
  the outstanding amount of issued debt (fixed income). For currency, perhaps as a function of monetary supply?
  - Pros: 
    - Given that the number of outstanding shares often changes multiple times throughout the course of a security's 
    life (due to corporate actions such as buybacks), dollar bars are robust in the face of these actions.
#### Information-Driven Bars:
The purpose of info-driven bars is to sample more frequently when new information arrives to the market.
- **Tick Imbalance Bars**:
- **Tick Runs Bars**:
- **Volume/Dollar Runs Bars**:

## Stage 3: Trading Strategy Development
Based on the intraday market data, students will develop their own trading strategy using 
technical analysis or machine learning techniques. The strategy should be able to generate buy or sell signals based on the market data, 
and the trading decisions should be backtested on historical data.
